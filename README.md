After selecting your desired equipment and placing it in your inventory, you will begin fighting.
During combat:
[1] attacks with the current item selected
[2] allows you to switch to a different item in your inventory
[3] will save your game.

{Post Battle}
Upon successfully beating the enemy, gold will be awarded and you will be brought back to the store.

Switching items makes no changes to your stats, When the enemy's health reaches zero the game does not end, trying to load a file without previously saving causes the game to crash.
